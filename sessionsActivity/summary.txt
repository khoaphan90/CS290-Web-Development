My attempt at the open weather API was both sucessful and unsuccessful. I was able to gain information using the
previous assignment with getting information from OWM, but had a hard time trying to understand and organize
how to work with it using multiple cities. This is challenging as I still have had a more difficult time trying
to understand the requests that must be made, maybe something that limits them will allow me to work with the 
integrity of my list.

During this session, I wanted to have a list that will be sent by the client that will then update the session with
more current results. This way, I the list can be more active. Again, controlling the requests was difficult for me
to understand at the current moment. Using the examples as a base, I was able to request the correct data and link
the views from the get and post data assignments. Creating the session was simple but organization was a lot to
manage all at once. I plan to spend more time reviewing this topic.
